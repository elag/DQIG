The mission of the Data Quality Interest Group (DQIG) is to call attention to the importance of data quality, and collaborate on solving current issues. 

There is no formal membership. Members are those who subscribe to either of the following communication channels:

* [DQIG channel](https://elag-community.slack.com/messages/CB41TMKL2/details/) on Slack
* [DQIG Team](https://github.com/orgs/elag/teams/dqig) on Github

## Background

Data quality is something which is hard to define, and not easy to detect programatically, but lot of parts of it are evident for metadata experts, developers and even for users.

If you are new to the field, I suggest to check some slides and the video we created for the ELAG 2018 data quality workshop: http://bit.ly/elag2018-data-quality-workshop. If you have more time, I suggest you to read two seminal papers:

* Bruce, Thomas R., and Diane I. Hillmann. “The Continuum of Metadata Quality: Defining, Expressing, Exploiting.” In Metadata in Practice, edited by D. Hillman and E. Westbrooks, 238–56. Chicago, IL: ALA Editions, 2004. http://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/7895.
* Ochoa, Xavier, and Erik Duval. “Automatic Evaluation of Metadata Quality in Digital Repositories.” International Journal on Digital Libraries 10, no. 2–3 (August 2009): 67–91. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00799-009-0054-4.

There are some PhD dissertations as well:

* Seth van Hooland, _Metadata Quality in the Cultural Heritage Sector: Stakes, Problems and Solutions_ (2009) http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~svhoolan/these.pdf
* Sascha Tönnies, _Quality Control using Semantic Technologies in Digital Libraries_ (2013) http://www.ifis.cs.tu-bs.de/sites/default/files/biblio/thesis_toennies_final_eversion_pdf_12334.pdf
* Nikos Palavitsinis, _Metadata Quality Issues in Learning Repositories_ (2014) http://blog.agroknow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Palavitsinis_Thesis_Final221113.pdf

## Scope
The group will:

* regularly read and discuss important articles ([metadata assessment bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/metadata_assessment))
* promote, improve and invent metrics to measure data quality
* discuss and collabore on tools
* discuss and collabore on visualisation
* discuss and collabore on communication on the results of measurements
* how to improve the quality

### Out of Scope
The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this group.

### Similar activities

The following projects has lots of commons with the interest group, but they are either concentrating on a concrete service or they does not have European community focus.

* [Europeana Data Quality Committee](https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee)
* [DLF Metadata Assessment Working Group](http://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/)
* [ADOCHS](http://adochs.be)
* [CONQUAIRE](http://conquaire.uni-bielefeld.de/)
* [Metadata 2020](http://metadata2020.org)
